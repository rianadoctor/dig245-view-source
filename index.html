                    <p>In arenas bathed in radiant light,<br>
                        Where hardwood floors glisten through the night,<br>
                        There's a game of grace and soaring flight,<br>
                        It's basketball, a sport that ignites.<br>
                        From Harlem's streets to courts worldwide,<br>
                        A passion burns, a swelling tide,<br>

                        Where teamwork and skill the victors make,<br>
                        In this game of hoops, no room for fake,<br>
                        Where legends rise with every dribble and break.<br>                       
                        The hoop, a portal to the boundless sky,<br>
                        Where players leap and on eagles' wings fly,<br>
                        Defying gravity, they reach so high,<br>
                        Their dunks and layups seem to touch the sky.<br>    
                        The crowd erupts in a deafening roar,<br>
                        As heroes emerge, their spirits soar,<br>
                        The scoreboard tells of battles won and sore,<br>
                        In this grand theater, where legends are born.<br> 
                        From Jordan's grace to LeBron's might,<br>

                        In this game of wit, where minds embark.<br>  
                        But it's more than points, rebounds, and steals,<br>
                        It's the heart and soul, what each player feels,<br>
                        The camaraderie, the friendships' seals,<br>
